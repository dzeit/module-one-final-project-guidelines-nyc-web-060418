# Contributing to Attract-US

We're really excited that you're about to contribute to the Attract-US Command Line Interface application. If this is your first time contributing, please continue reading to learn how to make the most meaningful and useful impact possible.

## Raising an Issue to Encourage a Contribution

If you notice a problem with the application that you believe needs improvement but you're unable to make the change yourself, you should raise a Github issue
containing a clear description of the problem. Include relevant snippets of the content and/or screenshots if applicable. We regularly review issue lists and your issue will be prioritized and addressed as appropriate.

## Submitting a Pull Request to Suggest an Improvement

If you see an opportunity for improvement and can make the change yourself go ahead and use a typical git workflow to make it happen:

* Fork this application's repository
* Make the change on your fork, with descriptive commits in the standard format
* Open a Pull Request against this repo

We will review your change and approve or comment on it in due course.

# Why Contribute?

By embracing an open-source contribution model, our goal is for the Attract-US application to become, in time, the best attraction-based CLI application the world has ever seen.

We need help from the community of Attract-US users to maintain and improve the application's content. Everything from fixing typos, to correcting outdated information, to adding more features - all contributions to making the application more effective (if that's even possible) are welcome!
